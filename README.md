# GermanNumbers
This is a small practice project I made as a combination of two things I've been learning these days:- python and german!



------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


To Run The project:
Download the GermanNumbers.exe file (It was created via NSIS, So it'll create a folder there)

Then, Go To:

GermanNumbers/.idea/main.exe

OR

Run the main.exe file

Voila! Hope you enjoy it.
