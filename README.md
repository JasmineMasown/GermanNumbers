# GermanNumbers
This is a small practice project I made as a combination of two things I've been learning these days:- python and german!


To Run The project:
Download the .exe file (It was created via NSIS, So it'll create a folder there)

Then, Go To:

GermanNumbers/.idea/main.exe

Voila! Hope you enjoy it.
